 migrating Faucet to blockchain
 website will contain > json file (ABI: application binary interface) 
         with meta info about our smart contract that will be deployed on blockchain
 to communicate to the smart contract deployed on blockchain,
 we need
 meta data of smart contract that will store
        1. on which address smart contract reside 0x23jbh423jh423hj4v2hj334verwkj 
        2. byte code
 SO
 FaucetContract.sol <converted/compiled to> json(ABI) file(which will contain byte code and metadata) <byte code is sent/migrated to> blockchain
 STEP 1 : write the smart contract FaucetContract.sol in contracts folder
        // contract name = contract contractName{}
 STEP 2 : in command line 'truffle compile' <> compile .sol to .json(which will contain byte code)
 STEP 3 : Specify migration in migration folder with a=name "2_faucet_migration.js"
        
                            // give access tosmart contract byte code
                            // const FaucetContract = artifact.require("Faucet");
                            // 
                            // module.exports = function (deployer){
                                      // deployer.deploy(FaucetContract)
                            // }
 STEP 4 : runc "truffle migrate"

web3.js : collection pf libs that allow interaction with local or remote ETH node using protocols [http,ipc,webSocket]

under terminal
          "truffle console"

get instance of ABI of smart-contract   
       syntax : const instance = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI of contract , address of smart contract in blockchain)
          const instance = new web3.eth.Contract(Faucet.abi, "0x2B437EC1E890E2858Cd4BE19c0A8143e7d7BcaE5")

       get address from ganache/contracts/Faucet/Address

not lets access variable funds data from smart-contract instance
       (here, funds() function is created by solidity to return data in variable "funds")
       (here, counter() function is created by solidity to return data in variable "counter")
       (here, test() function is created by solidity to return data in variable "test")
       
       const funds = await instance.methods.funds().call();
       const counter = await instance.methods.counter().call()
       const test = await instance.methods.test().call()

       funds
              output: 1000
       counter
              output: -20
       test
              output: 4294967295

now migrate it to blockchain

                            confirm it in ganache/contracts/faucet will have 2 ether
       METHOD 2
                            "truffle console"
                            web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: accounts[0], to: "0x3E5Ca378F68AaC01a5CA427BE36107F9FD5066AA",data: "0xa26759cb",value: "1000000000000000000"})

                            where:
                                   from: address of account from which to withdraw
                                   to: address of smart-contract to which eth need to transfered

realise that when u search a26759cb in /build/contract/Faucet.json the byte code will have it
